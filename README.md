Participating in Coding2Share initiative 
For this project, I am sharing data, statistical code and the manuscript for the project 
"The Effect of Narrow Networks of Healthcare Providers on Healthcare Expenditures and Provider Visits: The Role of Selective Contracting"

Project name: MEPS_ProviderNetworks
Project description: The objective of this study was to understand whether narrow network insurance plans have reduced healthcare 
expenditures and to identify the mechanism by which that reduction occurred. Data were drawn from the 2013 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.
We used two-part models to estimate the effect of narrow networks on expenditures and negative binomial models for visit counts of 
provider visits and drugs dispensed. 
No extrenal funding was received for this project.
